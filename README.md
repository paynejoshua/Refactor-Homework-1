What I changed and worked on for this homework assignment.

Brief:
I went through and found various div tags that could be cleaned up and organized. I combed through the html file to ensure that everything was ordered neatly and made sense and made changes to elements that were disorganized or unnecessary. I also made the overall html file more accessible by including aria-label on lines of code that needed more clarity. This was in an effort to make the website WCAG compliant. 

Here are all the changes that I made: 
  Line 12:HMTL Semantics fix. Replaced <div id="header"> with <Header></Header>
  Line 15:Added aria-label so that the company's name is given meaning to someone who is unable to see.
  Line 18: HTML Semantics fix. Replaced <div></div> with <nav></nav>
  Line 23-33: Added aria-label to define link.
  Line 40: Semantic fix: Instead of div replaced with img
  Line 43: Semantic fix: Instead of div replaced with section. Section informns this whole next part as one grouping
  Line 47: Fixed bug where id for search engine optimization wasn't defined so link above couldn't
           go to content. Semantic fix: Instead of div replaced with article.
  Line 56: Semantic fix: Instead of div replaced with article. Added aria-label to define link.
  Line 65: Semantic fix: Instead of div replaced with article tag. Added aria-label to define link.
  Line 75: Semantic fix: Instead of div replaced with aside tag
  Line 78-98: Semantic fix: Instead of div replaced with aside tag. Added aria-label for icon image.
  Line 108: Semantic fix: Instead of div replaced with footer tag. Added aria-label to define the heart shaped emoji.
  
  I also ensured that any elements that I changed in the html file was reflected in the css file to make sure the style of the   website was not impacted.
